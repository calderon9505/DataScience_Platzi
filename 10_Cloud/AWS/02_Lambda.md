# Lambda

Lambda is a compute service that lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers (**serverless service**).

You organize your code into *Lambda functions*. Lambda runs your function only when needed and scales automatically, from a few requests per day to thousands per second. 

> You pay only for the compute time that you consumeâ€”there is no charge when your code is not running.
